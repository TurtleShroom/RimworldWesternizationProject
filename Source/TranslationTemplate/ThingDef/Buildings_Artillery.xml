  <!-- EN: The twelve-pounder Napoleon, also known as the "Canon de L’Empereur", was a smooth-bore cannon developed by France in 1853. Popular with both sides of the American Civil War, the Napoleon was capable of firing ball, shell, and canister shot, thus making it versatile enough to replace nearly all previous field guns of the day. Compared to more modern, industrial mortars, these vintage cannons shoot farther distances but are more inaccurate due to the absence of computers, precision weights, or modern measures. -->
