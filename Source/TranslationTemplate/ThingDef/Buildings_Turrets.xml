  <!-- EN: The Gatling gun, designed by the American inventor Doctor Richard Gatling in 1861, was a field weapon which used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand crank, and firing loose ammunition using a gravity feed system from a hopper. The Model 1881 Gatling gun features many improvements over its predecessors, the most notable of which is the implementation of the 'Bruce'-style ammunition feed system, allowing the gun to use brass cartridges (.45-70 Gov.) for the first time. -->
